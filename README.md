# Order Execution Gateway

Electron application that executes trading orders received from various sources through pluggable adapters. Order cards remain in the interface after an order is placed and collapse to a header with a colored status dot that reflects the position lifecycle:

- **blue** – order placed, waiting for fill
- **yellow** – position opened
- **green/red** – position closed in profit/loss

A lightweight event bus emits `order:placed`, `position:opened`, `position:closed` and `order:cancelled` so other parts of the app can react to changes.

## Configuration

Default configuration files live in each service's `config/` directory (for example `app/services/orderCards/config`). To customize any of them, copy the file to a `config/` directory in the project root and adjust as needed. On startup the application deep‑merges local overrides onto the bundled defaults.

Example:

```bash
mkdir -p config
cp app/services/orderCards/config/order-cards.json config/order-cards.json
```

Notable configuration files include:

- [`app/services/brokerage/config/execution.json`](app/services/brokerage/config/execution.json) – execution providers and adapter settings.
- [`app/services/orderCards/config/order-cards.json`](app/services/orderCards/config/order-cards.json) – sources for incoming order cards.
- [`app/services/tradeRules/config/trade-rules.json`](app/services/tradeRules/config/trade-rules.json) – validation rules applied before orders are sent.
- [`app/services/dealTrackers/config/deal-trackers.json`](app/services/dealTrackers/config/deal-trackers.json) – trackers invoked when positions close.
- [`app/services/dealTrackers-source-tv-log/config/tv-logs.json`](app/services/dealTrackers-source-tv-log/config/tv-logs.json) – directories containing TradingView CSV logs.
- [`app/services/dealTrackers-source-mt5-log/config/mt5-logs.json`](app/services/dealTrackers-source-mt5-log/config/mt5-logs.json) – directories containing MetaTrader reports.
- [`app/services/dealTrackers-chartImages/config/chart-images.json`](app/services/dealTrackers-chartImages/config/chart-images.json) – chart screenshot service settings.
- [`app/services/instrumentInfo/config/tick-sizes.json`](app/services/instrumentInfo/config/tick-sizes.json) – tick size overrides for instrument metadata and point calculations.
