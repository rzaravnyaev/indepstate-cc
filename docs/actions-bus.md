# Actions Bus

The actions bus bridges service events and command execution. Services emit named events on
`servicesApi.actionBus` and the bus resolves them into runnable commands using the configuration in
`app/services/actions-bus/config/actions-bus.json`.

When the renderer loads, a toggle strip appears next to the settings button. Each configured action
with a `name` exposes a checkbox that enables or disables the action at runtime.

## Configuration

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "actions": [
    {
      "name": "TradingView automation",
      "label": "TV auto-lines",
      "enabled": false,
      "bindings": [
        {
          "event": "tv-tool-horzline",
          "action": "commandLine:lo stripSymbol({symbol}) {price} props=producingLineId:{lineId}"
        },
        {
          "event": "tv-tool-horzline-remove",
          "action": "commandLine:rm producingLineId:{lineId}"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "event": "order:placed",
      "action": "commandLine:notify order {id}",
      "name": "Notify on new orders"
    }
  ]
}
```

- `enabled` – disables the service entirely when `false`.
- `actions` – array describing event bindings. Each item can be a single binding or a group:
  - `event` – emitter event name (`bus.emit(eventName, payload)`).
  - `action` – command template. Values wrapped in `{curlyBraces}` are replaced with properties from
the emitted payload. Nested paths are not supported, but any top-level property can be referenced.
Objects are stringified and missing values resolve to empty strings.
  - `name` (optional) – identifier that groups bindings under a toggle. Named actions run only when
    the corresponding checkbox is enabled in the toolbar.
  - `label` (optional) – display name for the toggle. Defaults to `name` when omitted.
  - `enabled` (optional) – initial state for a named action when no saved toggle state exists.
    Defaults to `true`. A state saved through the toolbar takes precedence on later starts.
  - `bindings` (optional) – array of `{ event, action }` objects. Each binding inherits the parent's
    `name`, `label`, and `enabled` default and runs only when the toggle is enabled.

The configuration order determines the toggle order in the UI. Removing an action from the config also
removes its toggle on the next reload.

## Function expressions

Command templates can call small registered helper functions:

```json
{
  "event": "tv-tool-horzline",
  "action": "commandLine:lo stripSymbol({symbol}) {price} props=producingLineId:{lineId}"
}
```

Function arguments are resolved from payload placeholders before invocation. The built-in
`stripSymbol(value)` helper trims a TradingView-style symbol and removes the exchange prefix before
`:`, so `NYSE:AAA` becomes `AAA`; symbols without a prefix pass through unchanged. The built-in
`add(a, b, ...)` helper converts arguments to numbers and returns a precision-stable sum. The built-in
`dist(a, b)` helper converts both arguments to numbers and returns their absolute price difference.
`distPts(a, b)` converts that absolute price difference to points using the points/tick-size service and
the action payload symbol, which is useful for templates such as `stopOffsetPts:distPts({price},{rayPrice})`.
`distPtsPlus(a, b, extra)` does the same conversion and adds an extra point value in one direct helper
call, avoiding unsupported nested expressions.

`distPts` and `distPtsPlus` resolve tick size through the shared instrument-information service. A
warm provider/symbol snapshot remains synchronous. On a cold cache the action waits for one metadata
lookup (up to five seconds), then uses configured symbol/default fallback if the adapter has no
authoritative metadata. Async helper resolution preserves binding order for the event. Snapshot
changes are available to configured actions as `instrument-info:updated`.

The expression layer is intentionally small: it supports direct calls such as
`functionName({field})` or `functionName({a}, {b})`. It does not execute JavaScript and does not
support nested function calls. Unknown functions render as an empty string and are reported through
the actions bus error handler without stopping other actions.

Services can extend the registry during `initService`:

```js
servicesApi.actionBus.registerActionFunction('myHelper', (value, payload, entry) => {
  return String(value || '').trim();
});
```

The registration call returns a disposer, and `unregisterActionFunction(name)` is also available.

## Command runners

Every action expands to a command string which is executed by a registered runner:

- Without a prefix the action uses the default runner. The command line service installs itself as
the default runner, so `add {symbol}` or any other command line shortcuts work out-of-the-box.
- Prefixing the command with `runnerName:` routes the command to a specific runner. For example
  `commandLine:add {symbol} {price}` targets the command line service while `other:do-something`
  would call a runner registered under the name `other`.
- If an event fires before its runner is available the command is queued and executed once the runner
  registers.

Services attach new runners with `servicesApi.actionBus.registerCommandRunner(name, fn)` and can
optionally replace the default runner with `setCommandRunner(fn)`. The command handler receives three
arguments: the rendered command string, the action entry and the original payload.

## Renderer toggles

`actions-bus:hookRenderer` populates `<div id="actions-bus-toggles">` with one checkbox per named
action. Toggling a checkbox invokes `actions-bus:set-enabled` and the main process replies with the
updated state so the UI re-renders. Named toggle states are saved to `actions-bus-state.json` in
Electron's user-data directory and restored on the next application start. When no named actions
exist the container remains hidden. Delete the state file while the app is closed to reset all named
actions to their configured `enabled` defaults.

Service-specific integrations are documented alongside each service module. For TradingView
automation, see the [tv-listener service notes](tv-listener.md).

## Example: automatic level-order and order-card creation from TradingView line events

The following config creates two named actions that listen to TradingView horizontal-line events and
automatically generate order cards via the command line:

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "actions": [
    {
      "name": "TV LO",
      "label": "TV LO",
      "bindings": [
        {
          "event": "tv-tool-horzline-ray",
          "action": "commandLine:lo stripSymbol({symbol}) {price} props=stopOffsetPts:distPtsPlus({price},{rayPrice}, 1);producingLineId:{lineId}"
        },
        {
          "event": "tv-tool-horzline-remove",
          "action": "commandLine:rm producingLineId:{lineId}"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "TV OC",
      "label": "TV OC",
      "bindings": [
        {
          "event": "tv-tool-horzline-ray",
          "action": "commandLine:l 10 distPtsPlus({price},{rayPrice}, 1)"
        },
        {
          "event": "tv-tool-horzline-remove",
          "action": "commandLine:rm producingLineId:{lineId}"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### How it works

Both actions subscribe to the same pair of TradingView line events:

| Event | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `tv-tool-horzline-ray` | A horizontal line and ray is drawn on the TradingView chart |
| `tv-tool-horzline-remove` | That line is deleted from the chart |

**TV LO** — level-order card creation:
- On draw: runs `lo <symbol> <price> props=stopOffsetPts:<dist+1pts>;producingLineId:<lineId>`.
  - `stripSymbol({symbol})` strips the exchange prefix (e.g. `NYSE:AAPL` → `AAPL`).
  - `distPtsPlus({price},{rayPrice}, 1)` computes the distance between the level price and the ray anchor price in points, then adds 1 point — used as the `stopOffsetPts` override so the stop is just beyond the line.
  - `producingLineId:{lineId}` tags the card with the TV line ID so it can be cancelled by line removal.
- On remove: runs `rm producingLineId:<lineId>` to cancel the level-order card tied to that line.

**TV OC** — plain order card creation (no symbol context, price-distance sizing):
- On draw: runs `l 10 <distPtsPlus>`.
  - Passes `10` as the first positional argument (`sl`) and the price distance (line-to-ray, +1 pt) as the second positional argument (`tp`).
  - The `l` command automatically attaches the latest horizontal line ID as `producingLineId`; it does not accept `props=`.
- On remove: same `rm` cleanup as TV LO.

Both actions appear as independent toggles in the toolbar, so either can be enabled/disabled at
runtime without touching the config file.
